# Tiny Poetry Machine

A tiny poetry machine (adapted from the idea of [versostroj.cz](http://versostroj.cz)). 

When you push the button, it plays a random (30 seconds long) poem.

It's not perfect yet (it actually works quite erraticaly now), but the source files want to get online already.

## Guide

Guide with some pics will follow as soon as the first prototype works without errors.

## Digispark sketch

I started with a nice and clean library. It did not work (because of a bad solder somewhere, probably). So I made just few lines of code to make it simple.

## Why?

Poetry, <3, Open Source Is Love
